In the beganning I have used Node and perform crud operation and store data in a text file.
After that I have created server with the help of express,MongoDB,Mongoose,Mongoshell
I have created MVC structure to handle files separately.
I have performed CRUD operation and saved the data in mongoDB.
Before performing the CRUD operation the user has to sign up first then login.
After login user can perform operation
